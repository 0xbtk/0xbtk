# Btk's smart contract security portfolio

Welcome to my Smart Contract Security Portfolio! In this repository, you can find all the information you need about me regarding my smart contract security skills and expertise.

# About btk

Benterki Ayoub aka [`btk`](https://code4rena.com/@btk), is an independent smart contract security researcher with no tech background. I've discovered many security vulnerabilities (i.e. HMs) doing Code4rena contests. Here is a breakdown of my skills and expertise:

- Smart Contract Development: I can develop smart contracts from scratch, following best practices. My expertise spans various DeFi projects, from Staking, Lending, Stablecoin, NFTs, Yield Aggregator, to Derivatives.

- Foundry Test Writing: I can create foundry (Unit / Invariant) tests for your codebase from scratch, guaranteeing full code coverage.

- Smart Contract Security Reviews: I can deliver a high quality ppv (Pay Per Vulnerability) audit. You can review my audit findings [here](https://github.com/0xbtk/portfolio/tree/main#btks-overall-findings).
